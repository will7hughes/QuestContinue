# QuestContinue
When you accept a quest it will be added to the quest watch list and set to super tracked. 
That way you don't have to go to the quest list and manually right-click -> track quest. 
This is a very lightweight quality of life mod.
If you are accepting a quest, odds are, you want to do that quest next. 
It just makes sense.

This also works for quests that have multiple chapters.
