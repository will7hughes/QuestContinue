# QuestContinue
When you accept a quest it will be added to the quest watch list and set to super tracked. <br>
That way you don't have to go to the quest list and manually right-click -> track quest.  <br>
This is a very lightweight quality of life mod. <br>
If you are accepting a quest, odds are, you want to do that quest next.  <br>
It just makes sense. <br> <br>

This also works for quests that have multiple chapters.
